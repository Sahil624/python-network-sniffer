# Python Network Sniffer

#### This is simple version of network sniffer made in python.

 A Sniffer (also known as a network analyzer, protocol analyzer or packet analyzer, or for particular types of networks, an Ethernet sniffer or wireless sniffer) is a computer program or a piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic passing over a digital network or part of a network. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.
